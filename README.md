# TicTacToeGame

First project (Project Zero) of web development immersive (12 wk course) at General Assembly (Sydney). Code was intentionally written long hand in javascript to better built up my fundamentals and syntax of that language and I purposefully avoided jQuery. My intention is to recode this project at a later time to reduce most of the repetition & redundancy in code and use jQuery to built up my knowledge of its syntax.

## background

## Features

- two player mode
- can change tokens:

  - Classic - X vs O;
  - Presidential - Hillary vs Trump;
  - Day of the Dead - Mexican DofD images;
  - Space - gifs of solarflare vs moon;

    - tokens and backgrounds change

- different messages for win by row, column or diagonal, or draw;
- tokens originate on button click, then are disabled;
- player scoreboard for wins;
- reset game and reset scoreboard functionality;
- single player vs computer AI (simple random choice); operates when button is clicked. Will add in harder AI functionality so you can choose which AI to play each turn. Set up for computer to go second at the moment.

```javascript
```

## Usage

## Technology

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### Libraries / Plugins

- [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js)

## Issues / Bugs

- can select different tokens midway through game but this functionality is intentional but will need to built in logic so that you can remember the different tokens and match them (all first player vs second player) into game logic as a variant.
- game allows you to continue after win if you do not select reset. May hardcode to prevent this.

## Backlog / Futures Releases

- will reduce redundancy in code and use jQuery as another version.
- implement harder AI and have functionality to use harder or easier per turn.
- add soundtracks per selection; just one soundtrack at the moment.

## Acknowledgments

- use of images for gifs and music audio.
